# Zillow_Web_Scraping
An application I created to automatically create a Google form of apartment listings.

It is an exercise from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: Python", with some modifications.

You will need to create a Google form with the following fields: Address and Link.

The headers provided are necessary to navigate around Zillow's "blockers". These methods are subject to change should Zillow update 
how they handle bots.

When the application is run, you will have a list of apartments for rent with you desired filters applied beforehand on the Zillow site.
